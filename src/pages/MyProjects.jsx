                <p>This was my first ever project. A simple rock paper scissors game <br/>
                   made using HTML, CSS, and vanilla Javascript. Kind of incredible if <br/>
                   thought about. How much these technologies can accomplish with DOM <br/>
                   manipulation...<br/> <br/>

                <p>My second project really introduced the speed and efficiency of React <br/>
                   into my tech skills. Even though DOM manipulation can create almost anything <br/>
                   on the web, using React can make a webpage faster, quicker and easier to <br/>
                   load and use. Not to mention the awesomeness that is APIs! Using web data to <br/>
                   create fun and cool apps was awesome and so I built a simple weather app that <br/>
                   gives real time weather in any city in the world. <br/> <br/>

                <p> The third project I'm currently working on is a weather mood tracker. The <br/>
                    idea for this project sort of evolved over time and after discovering weather<br/>
                    mood trackers on Etsy, I decided I want to create a digital weather mood tracker.<br/>
                    There are still a few kinks to work on, but the app has a backend portion that <br/>
                    connects to MongoDB that stores users data and requires authentication to use the <br/>
                    mood tracker/diary portion of the app.
