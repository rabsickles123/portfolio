                    Thanks for visiting my portfolio! Let me tell you a little about myself: <br/> <br/>
                    My name is Rabia and I'm an aspiring software engineer. I graduated from Per Scholas'<br/> 
                    software engineering training program in February 2024. Prior to this, I was working <br/>
                    as a lab tech in an environmental company. While important and necessary, lab work was <br/>
                    becoming stagnant and stale. I wanted to learn something new and exciting and stumbled <br/>
                    across python. This journey into the world of code led me to Per Scholas and full stack  <br/>
                    development, specifically the MERN stack. This website is a collection of the projects I <br/>
                    built in my four month journey at Per Scholas and what I intend to build in the upcoming <br/>
                    months and years.<br/> <br/>
                    Take a gander and leave me some feedback!<br/> <br/> <br/>
